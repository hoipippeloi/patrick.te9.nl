about
"First and foremost; I love to translate data into insights. I know that building data-driven solutions, for learning and decision making, requires you to put in effort into multiple facets of this intriguing craftsmanship. An optimal solution takes into account the many ways in which data can be transformed and calculated to measure or contextualize all these events and occurrences. Naturally, analysis is done in top-down fashion, breaking down the elements of a bigger picture to understand all the parts. This means as an information and analytics designer you need to understand what this ‘big picture’ and associated logic looks like, to be able to build different types of analysis. Such solutions help a consumer follow its path from top to bottom, where in the end a conclusion or narrative can be derived."

"Together we need to:"

"- Understand where the data is captured for what purpose"
- Know which people might benefit from it in their daily lives
- How measurement of one thing might influence others
- Design solutions with consistency, flow and a holistic top-down methodology
- Talk to consumers about inefficiencies or next steps
- Keep asking ‘Is this the easiest way possible?’
- Experiment with data, representation and arrangement to understand the rules and constraints

What I Believe.

Adoption
Comes from a user’s experience. If they can’t understand or use it, it is worthless.

Design
Only the data and logic you apply can inform design decisions. If you don’t care about a metric’s logic and associations, you can’t analyze the outcomes.

Start @ End
Data is only valuable when it enables learning or decision making. You can only draw a conclusion at the end of an analysis. That is where a good design starts.

Simplicity
“It’s easy to make things complex.” Commit to turn this idea 180 degrees.

Have Ideas
“We don’t know what we don’t know. Explore, experiment and break stuff to figure out.” This is the start for improvement or maybe see things from a whole new perspective.

Time = Valuable
Time is expensive, demand exceeds supply. Keep your things brief and relevant!
