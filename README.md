# Personal Website Template

Here is a personal website template I use to present, highlight and inform people about me. You can use this template anyway you want 
for your own personal site.

- Just clone the repository with "git clone https://github.com/hoipippeloi/patrick.te9.nl.git"
- Then "npm install" the repo
- After this run "npm run sources"
- Last, run "npm run dev"

Now you can open your site in any IDE and start changing the content and data.

Best of luck,
